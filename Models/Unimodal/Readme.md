In this first approach, called the unimodal approach, we intend to predict if a patient has COVID-19 or not based on its chest radiograph. For this task, a binary classification problem based on images, we rely on deep convolutional networks, drawing inspiration from [1] *Automated abnormality classification of chest radiographs using deep convolutional neural networks*. This paper is an overview that shows that several convolutional architectures like VGG, ResNet, DenseNet etc. achieve high or very high accuracies (ROC AUC) in this type of binary classification task with radiographs. It is worth highlighting that our target variable (COVID19 positive/negative) is different to the one employed in the mentioned paper (general "abnormality" in the chest radiograph), and that in a good portion of cases, a COVID19 positive patient does not show any abnormality in its chest radiograph that is perceptible for humans. For this reason, one of the first hypothesis that we set is that the accuracies we will obtain will be lower than those showed in the paper.

We select three architectures, ResNet, DenseNet, and GoogLeNet, following a criteria of performance in the aforementioned study.
