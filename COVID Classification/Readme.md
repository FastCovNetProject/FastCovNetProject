# Important note - COVID19 Classification using Deep Learning:

This folder and its subfolders contain the reports, code, explanations and experiment results related to COVID19 Classification using Deep Learning from our project. The logic of this project at this point has been sequential, and thus the [ChestCovNet](/ChestCovNet/) folder should be read **first** and the [FastCovNet](/ChestCovNet/) folder **second**.
